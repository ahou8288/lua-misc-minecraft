# lua-misc-minecraft

This repo contains a lot of my miscelanious code.

## VBA

The HSC project folder has an excel file where the board game RISK has been recreated using VBA macros.
This was my HSC major project, and my first introduction to programming.

## Lua

The lua files in this repo are scripts written for the ComputerCraft Minecraft mod.
These scripts where to build things and chop trees and dig snow and stuff.

## Rivers

This was a small project to download info for all the rivers in NSW and all of the rainfall data for these areas for data analytics purposes later.
